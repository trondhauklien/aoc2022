# Advent of Code 2022 âœ¨
This is my solutions to Advent of Code 2022.

### Solution scripts
Solution scripts are formatted `day-part.py` e.g. `13-2.py` (for day 13 part 2) for most puzzles, except some days where I could not bother to copy the file, since the code change required to get the solution for part two was quite small.

### Puzzle input
The solution script for each day takes a `.txt` file as the puzzle input, formatted `day.txt` e.g. `1.txt` for day. 

For day 5, the input was split into two files, with the starting crate configuration as `5-1.txt` and the crane movement procedure as `5-2.txt`.

### Output files and debugging
Some scripts output a ton of debugging text to the terminal and some even writes to a file to visualize data related to that day's puzzle.
